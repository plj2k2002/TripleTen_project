Random Event Simulation Tool
This project is a tool designed to simulate random events. It provides a user-friendly interface to generate and visualize random events using various methods and libraries.

Description
The Random Event Simulation Tool allows users to simulate a wide range of random events for various purposes such as statistical analysis, educational demonstrations, and decision-making scenarios. The tool leverages Python programming language and several libraries to implement the simulation functionalities.

Methods and Libraries Used
Methods:
Random Number Generation
Monte Carlo Simulation
Markov Chains
Libraries:
Streamlit: Used for building the interactive web application interface.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
Plotly Express: Used for data visualization, including histograms and scatter plots.
